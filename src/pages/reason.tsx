        <h3>Another FYI: Wrapper Offline Desktop used to be called Wrapper Offline Electron.</h3>

            Background Info
          </h2>
          <p className="">Let's get started. So, all of you may be wondering what Wrapper Offline Desktop is.</p>
          <p className="">
            Wrapper Offline Desktop was simply just a fork of Wrapper Offline. Basically, we took their source code, and
            added work to their source code. Wrapper Offline Desktop is based on Wrapper Offline pretty much.
          </p>
          <p className="">
            Wrapper Offline only supported Windows before. I wanted to make Wrapper Offline to be able to support MacOS
            and Linux as well, because not everyone had Windows.
          </p>
          <p>
            Wrapper Offline Desktop was meant to be open-source as well, following the MIT license. That way, other
            people can come in and contribute if they wanted to.
          </p>
          <p>Anyways, enough with the background information, we have to get straight to the point.</p>
          <hr className="my-5" />
          <h2 className="my-4" id="personalthreat">
            Personal Threat
          </h2>
          <p>
            I pretty much advertised Wrapper Offline Desktop whenever someone had a problem or they were not a Windows
            user. In the image below, WOE stood for "Wrapper Offline Electron," the original name of Wrapper Offline
            Desktop.
          </p>
          <img src={I1} width="600" height="auto" />
          <img src={I2} width="400" height="auto" />
          <p className="mt-5">
            That person from Wrapper Offline told me to kill myself for absolutely no reason when I asked help from him.
          </p>
          <img src={I3} width="500" height="auto" />
          <img src={I4} width="400" height="auto" />
          <p className="mt-5">"Oh don't care about what other people say about you."</p>
          <p>
            I don't, but telling someone to kill themself is more different than insulting someone.{' '}
            <b>You're telling someone to commit suicide, and you think that's just nothing?</b>
          </p>
          <p>
            Of course, I don't care about what he said, but at the same time, you really want to get that toxic and tell
            me to commit suicide? Inappropriate, and very toxic coming from the community, especially when I did not
            even do anything wrong.
          </p>
          <p>
            I reported him and Discord did nothing, as well as the Wrapper Offline server did nothing because "it wasn't
            in their jurisdiction." Someone could just spam personal DMs to other server members and they wouldn't get
            in trouble, how funny, because it isn't in their jurisdiction.

            Defamation
          </h2>
          <p>
            One person from the Wrapper Offline community tried to spread false negative information about me, calling
            me a "scammer" with no evidence. This is called defamation.
          </p>
          <p>
            To start off, I sent him a message saying if he wants to test out Wrapper Offline Desktop/Electron, and he
            thought I was trying to scam him just for doing that. He has no evidence.
          </p>
          <img src={I5} width="500" height="auto" />
          <img src={I6} width="400" height="auto" />
          <p className="mt-5">
            He tried saying that I was a scammer, which was completely false. He even tried to "Call Staff" on me.
            Someone was actually backing me up, if you can look at the pictures.
          </p>
          <img src={I7} width="700" height="auto" />
          <img src={I8} width="700" height="auto" />
          <img src={I9} width="700" height="auto" />
          <p className="mt-5">
            To sum it up, he tried to tell everyone that I am a scammer, and tried to falsely report on me by calling
            staff, but the pictures provided above show no evidence of scamming, and I never even asked for money in the
            first place. There was no proof of Wrapper Offline Desktop being fake, either.

            Trolling
          </h2>
          <p>I support the Wrapper Offline developers for their hard work on the project.</p>
          <p>Though, they have one of the most toxic behaviors out there.</p>
          <p>Octanuary, who is mainly involved in the project, thought it would be cool to troll me.</p>
          <p>
            I was testing my Wrapper Offline Desktop program, and it wasn't loading the videos {'('}which was a bug on
            my end so I fixed it later{')'}, so I wanted to make sure the videos were supposed to load, because it's
            just I've heard stuff from how Wrapper Offline was buggy and all.
          </p>
          <p>
            Be AWARE, I am a MacOS user. I don't use Windows, and Wrapper Offline was only supported for Windows that
            time. I didn't have a VM or Windows PC to test the app.
          </p>
          <p>I asked, "Does Wrapper Offline beta load the videos, right?"</p>
          <p>It was a simple question, Octanuary could've answered, "Yes."</p>
          <p>
            Instead, he tried to troll me. Roadrunner and shezsparrkz also trolled me, but shezsparrkz was banned so the
            messages were deleted, and roadrunner deleted his messages too, where you can see the "Original messages
            deleted" with my replies.

          <p className="mt-5">"Oh, he was just trying to joke around with you!"</p>
          <p>
            If he was trying to joke around with me, he would've told me sooner or later. Also, why would you joke
            around over a dang simple question?
          </p>

          <p className="mt-5">
            He admitted that he trolled me; how? He said, "It was an OBVIOUS answer." That was the reason why he trolled
            me, because it was an "obvious answer."
          </p>
          <p>
            You're not supposed to troll people because it is an obvious answer,{' '}
            <b>just say "Yes." It's a simple question.</b> People think they get to troll someone if the answer is
            obvious to a question. Wow.

            I tried to explain that I was testing Wrapper Offline on MacOS {'('}the image above{')'}, so there's
            possibilities that Wrapper Offline could not be working on different platforms {'('}which is not true now
            {')'}, but he never replied back.
          </p>

              Let's get to the biggest part of this. This part I'm about to explain to you is one of the worst toxic
              behaviors I've seen here. There were manipulation, being teamed on, someone abusing their mod power on me,
              and etc.
            </b>
          </p>
          <p>Someone started drama on me. You can see in the image below, someone just randomly mentioned me.</p>
          <img src={I18} width="700" height="auto" />
          <img src={I19} width="700" height="auto" />
          <p className="mt-5">He ignored me and I got agitated, therefore I called him out on ignoring me.</p>
          <p>
            How can an app become "official?" Ask Google to make it official? Have Microsoft give me a certificate?
            Nothing can become official, unless you call it "official."
          </p>
          <p>
            In the image below, another person, MKAnimates, decided to lead on the drama. I haven't even said anything
            bad or negative, towards anyone.

          <img src={I20} width="700" height="auto" />
          <p className="mt-5">
            The picture sent by MKAnimates in the image above consists of me calling MKAnimates out on ignoring me too.

          <img src={I22} width="700" height="auto" />
          <p className="mt-5">
            I had to defend myself, so in the image above, I wanted to expose both of them for trying to start drama on
            me, and I wanted to expose both of them on the stuff they did against me.
          </p>
          <p>
            Also, if I call them out for ignoring me, why do they answer me now? They didn't answer before, but if I
            call them out, they answer me now. How crazy.
          </p>
          <img src={I23} width="700" height="auto" />
          <p className="mt-5">
            In the image above, one of the people were ignoring me. I waited days for a response, we're not talking
            hours, we're talking days.
          </p>
          <p>Let's get to the part where people start taking it too far.</p>
          <img src={I24} width="500" height="auto" />
          <img src={I25} width="1000" height="auto" />
          <p className="mt-5">
            In the image above, MKAnimates was lying about me, saying I "would force people to download Wrapper Offline
            Desktop."
          </p>
          <p>
            He has no proof of me forcing others to download Wrapper Offline Desktop, and instead, he was angry that I
            got mad at him for ignoring me.
          </p>
          <p>
            It's totally fine if you don't want to use Wrapper Offline Desktop, but I will get upset if you ignore me,
            because that's different. Ignoring doesn't mean "I don't want to use Wrapper Offline Desktop," ignoring can
            mean so many things.
          </p>
          <img src={I26} width="700" height="auto" />
          <img src={I27} width="700" height="auto" />

          <p>
            He also said that he was going to tell the whole Wrapper Offline team about me. This means he's trying to
            start drama and spread bad information about me.
          </p>
          <p>
            In Wrapper Offline server, it is against the rules to put outside drama into the server. I would consider
            this "outside drama" that MKAnimates has started, and he threatened to tell the Wrapper team about me, about
            this outside drama.
          </p>
          <p>The image below shows proof that it is against the rules to put outside drama in the server.</p>
          <img src={I28} width="700" height="auto" />
          <img src={I29} width="700" height="auto" />
          <p className="mt-5">MKAnimates also tried to make others view me negatively.</p>
          <p>
            MKAnimates pinged octanuary, and tried to send him a picture of my criticism on octanuary, which may have
            changed octanuary's views on me. This is probably one of the reasons why I was muted.
          </p>
          <img src={I30} width="300" height="auto" />
          <img src={I31} width="900" height="auto" />
          <p className="mt-5">
            And yes, I got muted. If you want proof that I got muted, scroll all the way down to the last 5 minute
            video, and see how my message sending is disabled in the bottom part of the video.
          </p>
          <img src={I32} width="500" height="auto" />
          <img src={I33} width="900" height="auto" />
          <p className="mt-5">
            I asked octanuary why he muted me, and he said that I started the drama. I've already proved my point. I
            never started drama, it was MKAnimates and TheToonsJosh who started the drama. I was only defending myself.
          </p>
          <p>I consider octanuary abusing his mod powers here.</p>
          <p>
            To sum it up, octanuary, MKAnimates, TheToonsJosh all did a bad thing towards me. The Wrapper Offline
            developer, octanuary, abused his mod powers on me, and he was only warned. MKAnimates and TheToonsJosh were
            only warned, yet they did a lot to try to harm my reputation.

            I tried talking to Octanuary. I wanted to chat this out with him, and be cool with him.

          <p>He never responded back, though.</p>
          <img src={I36} width="300" height="auto" />
          <p className="mt-5">
            In the image above, you can see that MKAnimates has said, "{'['}Curzon{']'} is really nice."
          </p>
          <p>
            Instead, Octanuary sends a "blender intro" containing the "White n*gga" text. That is his response of when
            something good was said about me. He probably means it in a bad way, and this shows that Octanuary has no
            remorse for me, yet I never did anything wrong to him.

            Conclusion
          </h2>
          <p>
            The Wrapper Offline community is unique in different ways, such as a variety of GoAnimators who want to make
            new animations for everyone else to watch.
          </p>
          <p>
            Though, I've heard so much negative stuff about the community, as well. Horrendous things... literally, some
            dude's address was leaked in the GoAnimate City server.
          </p>
          <p>
            Octanuary, is a very good developer, but not a very smart person. He didn't make the best decisions, and he
            was also against me for whatever reason, I don't know why.
          </p>
          <p>Octanuary and the others have not ever apologized for the negative actions they made towards me.</p>
          <p>
            Hopefully, some people read this and they understand that this community isn't something you would expect
            "perfectly safe."
          </p>
          <p>
            If you read the whole thing, thank you so much for reading. This took a good amount of time for me to make.
            I had to get all of the screenshots and make GIFs to prove that these messages were real and not fake.
          </p>
          <p>
            I only wanted to make this community better by bringing in something handy like Wrapper Offline Desktop, but
            instead, with all my hard work, I get faced with drama and negativity. I'm not even getting paid to make
            Wrapper Offline Desktop.
          </p>
          <p>Appreciate what you have.</p>
